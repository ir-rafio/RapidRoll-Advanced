# Rapid Roll Advanced
Rapid Roll Advanced is a game developed using C++ and SFML. It takes inspiration from the classic Nokia game from our childhood, providing a nostalgic experience that resonates with the players. The game stays true to the original concept while adding new dimensions that make it more challenging and engaging. With improved graphics, animation, and soundtrack, the game provides players with an entertaining gaming experience.

## Features
- Realistic Physics: The physics of the game is implemented to provide players with a smooth and responsive gameplay experience, challenging their reflexes and providing an adrenaline rush that makes the game more immersive.
- **New Items**
    - Coin: This item gives a score bonus.
    - Gem: This item grants an extra life to the player.
    - Boost: This item accelerates the ball. Although it is difficult to control initially, with practice, skilled players can learn to take advantage of its increased velocity.
    - Protection: This item grants temporary invincibility, allowing you to pass through spikes unharmed. It's a game-changer when you're playing at higher levels.
    - Slowdown: This item slows down time, making it easier to navigate through obstacles and spikes. It's a very helpful item in the later part of the game.
- **New Challenges**
As your score increases, new challenges appear to make the game more difficult and interesting.
    - Moving Platforms: These platforms move horizontally, vertically, or both. They require precise timing and control to pass.
    - Spikes: These are obstacles that can instantly destroy the ball. Be aware of these sharp and pointy hazards. Players need to plan their movements carefully to navigate around them and avoid losing the game.
    - Bouncy Platforms: These platforms add a fun element to the game by bouncing the ball off in a different direction. However, there is a danger that you may collide with the ceiling.
- High Score System: The high-score system allows players to keep track of their personal best scores and compete with friends, making every playthrough a chance to set a new record.

## Technologies Used
Rapid Roll Advanced was developed using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) library. The project used various object-oriented programming concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, function and operator overloading, templates, virtual and abstract functions, enumerations, and exceptions.

## Installation
- **Powershell**
    - Download and install PowerShell if you haven't already.
    - Download or clone the project source code to a directory of your choice.
    - Navigate to the project directory in PowerShell.
    - Run the makeSFML.ps1 script.
- **Installer**
    - You can use the installer to install the game directly and start playing.

Note: If you are using PowerShell on Windows and get an error message about script execution being disabled, you can enable script execution by opening a PowerShell session as an administrator and running the following command:
```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned```
This will allow PowerShell to run scripts that are locally created, but not ones downloaded from the internet. If you want to allow scripts from the internet as well, you can use the Unrestricted option instead:
```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted```
