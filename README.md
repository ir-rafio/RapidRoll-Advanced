# Fox's Tale
A tribute to the classic Rapid Roll game from our childhood made with love, tears and SFML.

## For Windows
Run make.ps1 using powershell.  
Options:   
> -h/help - Shows help menu  
> -c/compile - Compiles the project  
> -cr - Compiles the project without the roll function (if compilcation arises)
> clean - Deletes the .o files  
> cleanall - Deletes the *.o and *.exe files  
> -a/all - Does all the above except deleting the .exe file  
> To execute the game run the executable  

The .exe can be found in ./bin  
The -a flag or -e doesnt execute properly due to failure to load resources.  
Git somehow corrupts the symbolic link thus creates execution failure.
